### A Modern Lost & Found Web Application

LOSTit is a web application designed to help users find and return lost items. It provides a simple, secure platform for users to report lost or found items, view a public gallery of items, and securely claim their belongings. The application leverages a serverless architecture, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

* **Secure Authentication:** User login and registration are handled via AWS Amplify and Amazon Cognito, ensuring a secure and reliable authentication process.
* **Item Management:** Users can upload details of lost or found items, including images, descriptions, and location.
* **Public Gallery:** A public-facing gallery displays all active lost and found items, allowing anyone to view what has been reported.
* **Item Verification:** Each uploaded item generates a unique verification code and QR code. This allows the original owner to verify an item without exposing personal contact information.
* **Item Claiming:** Authenticated users can securely claim an item, initiating a handover process that connects the original uploader with the claimant.
* **Serverless Architecture:** The backend is built using AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3), providing a highly scalable and maintenance-free solution.
